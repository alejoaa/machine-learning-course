# Machine Learning exercises
This repository contains code I completed from programming exercises from the Machine Learning Course by Andrew NG on Coursera. The course can be found here: [https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning).

The algorithms implemented in the exercises are:
- Linear regression
- Logistic regression
- Regularized logistic regression
- Neural Networks
- Support Vector Machines
- K-means Clustering
- Principal Component Analysis
